# Cello-v2.1-Core
This software package is a streamlined algorithm for designing genetic circuits based on logic gate designs written in the Verilog format. It executes through the command-line interface by calling the 'celloAlgo.py' script. CELLO-2.1 is capable of efficiently handling single-cellular (with multicellular support coming soon) partitioning with multiple-output support, generating results saved in a local directory on your machine, with verbose logging, ang with GUI interface coming soon.


#
## Running with Docker (Option 1)
If you don't mind running the program in the console without a graphical user interface, you can do the following...

### Docker Pull
You can pull the image for this core algorithm from the Docker Hub...
```
docker pull
```

### Docker Build
Alternatively, you can build the docker image with the following command, executed from the root directory...
```
docker build . -t "cidarlab/cello-core-v2-1"
```

### Docker Run
After either pulling or building the image, you can start the container as follows...
```
docker run -i -v <LOCAL_DIR_TO_SAVE_RESULTS>:/app/temp_out -v <LOCAL_DIR_TO_SAVE_LOGS>:/app/logs -t cello-core-test
```
-i makes the run interactive so that you can interface with the program in the console

-v creates a bind mount to save files on your local system


#
## Running with Source (Option 2)

### Cloning the Repo
```
git clone https://github.com/CIDARLAB/Cello-v3-Core.git
cd Cello-v3-Core/
```

#
### Installing Python Packages
Install using pip (will be updated with poetry...)
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#
### Installing [YOSYS](https://yosyshq.net/yosys/download.html) and Graphviz
#### For OSX / Linux
To install Yosys (which includes Graphviz), the easiest way is through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh). With homebrew installed, you can simply run:
```
brew install yosys
```

#
#### For Windows
**Graphviz**

First, you will need to manually install Graphviz, required for running Yosys. You can download the latest .exe installer [here](https://www.graphviz.org/download/). Then, follow the instructions for the install dialog box.

Next, you will need to add the graphviz bin folder to your ```Path``` environment variable. Search for "edit environment variables" in the Windows menu, go to the dialog box, and click "Edit" on the variable named ```Path```. Then click "New" once you see the values of the ```Path``` variable. Now you can the path of the Graphviz bin to the list, by default it is ```C:\Program Files\Graphviz\bin```

Now, you should have graphviz installed as an executable command. Test it by trying: ```dot -v```

If no errors show up, Graphviz is correctly installed, and you can set up Yosys next.

**Yosys**

Go to [here](https://github.com/YosysHQ/oss-cad-suite-build/releases/tag/2023-06-16) and download the OSS Cad Suite, remember to select the architecture for your PC.

Click the downloaded file to extract it, and move the extracted folder to a location suitable for software packages. 

You should see a folder named ```oss-cad-suite```, and move the folder to a location such as ```C:\Documents\folder``` for example, and open up PowerShell:
```
cd C:\Documents\folder\
oss-cad-suite\start.bat
```

Running the above commands will load the "oss-cad-suite" libraries in your existing shell environment.

With your shell now set up, you can now cd into ```\Cello-v3-Core``` and begin experimenting.

#
#### For Other Platforms
Please check [YOSYS installation guide](https://yosyshq.net/yosys/download.html) for other platforms

#
### Running CELLO
```
python run.py
```
Follow the prompts for which Verilog and UCF you would like to use.

You will see the results and the optimized design in the *outpath* folder.

Alternatively, you could make a script to call the ```CELLO3``` process and use this codebase as an API.

#
### Library
Input files can be found in the [library](/library/) folder. This includes the UCF files for Cello, as well as a few dozen 
Verilog files. You may use your own Verilog files (structural or behavioral) or modified UCF files.

#
### Example Output
Here is an example of what the result from Cello looks like in the terminal. 
It uses the and.v circuit pared with Bth1C1G1T1 UCF. 
After running this experiment, you will see other files generated in the output folder as well. 
The important takeaways are the *circuit score* and the *design*, which will be returned to the terminal. 
Because additional convenience features are on the backlog, it is important to check the terminal for the *circuit score* and the *design* Cello made.

Example resulting design outputted by Cello.

#
### Try Oriole
The size of the design that CELLO-2.1 can handle is limited by the number of genetic parts specified in the UCF files. To achieve intra-cellular partitioning for large circuit designs, consider first using [Oriole](https://github.com/CIDARLAB/genetic-circuit-partitioning-new.git) to partition the design into smaller circuits, and then feed them into CELLO-2.1. 

#
### Complexity
**Time Complexity (exhaustive algorithm):**

$$
O((I)P(i) \cdot (G)P(g) \cdot (O)P(o))
$$

Where capital letters represent the available set of Inputs, Gates, and Outputs from the UCF, and lowercase letters represent the set of Inputs, Gates, and Outputs required by the logic circuit.

**Space Complexity (exhaustive algorithm):**

$$
O(2^i \cdot (i+g+o))
$$

Only one iteration is stored in the memory at a time in the exhaustive pass. Each iteration has to store a truth table where each row has inputs toggled ON/OFF. The circuit for the intermediate logic circuit design placement is stored in memory with different data for each row.
